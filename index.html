								<h2 class="major">Welcome to my world <br />of Engineering </h2>
								<p>
								
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/projects.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
								Below are some of the projects that I have undertaken in my undergratuate level here at 
									<a href="https://www.cornell.edu">Cornell University!  </a>
								<br /> Most of my projects are open sourced. 
								</p>

								<br /><h2 class="major"> RFID Door Lock Project</h2>
								Designed a door lock mechanism using RFID(Radio Frequency IDentification) technology. 
								This was just a project that helped showcased how we interact with our surroundings. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/RFIDDoorLock.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							
								In the realm of technological innovation, the journey of creating the RFID Door Lock System was nothing short of transformative. 
								It all began with a vision to redefine traditional door locks using advanced Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. 
								Developed meticulously, this project symbolizes the fusion of engineering expertise and inventive design.
								The initial phase was marked by a deep dive into the intricacies of RFID technology. 
								
								<br />Below is the circuit schematic of the project <br />
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Arduino-RFID.png" alt="" /></span>
								I embarked on a journey to comprehend its inner workings, establishing a solid foundation for the project. 
								With a profound understanding of RFID, I transitioned to the hardware assembly phase.
								The central component, the MFRC522 RFID Module, served as the cornerstone of the system. 
								This remarkable device facilitated precise reading of RFID cards, unlocking a world of possibilities. 
								The integration of a Servo Motor introduced a graceful and efficient mechanism for door control. 
								To enhance user interaction and feedback, I incorporated an LCD Display, transforming the system into an intuitive experience.
								The Arduino Board played a pivotal role as the brain of the operation, orchestrating seamless communication between components. 
								However, the true magic materialized in the software domain. I crafted custom code that enabled the microcontroller to 
								communicate with RFID cards, granting access, and maintaining a comprehensive access log. User-friendliness was a top priority. 
								Thus, the user interface was designed to be as intuitive as possible.
								Rigorous testing and refinement ensued, embodying the essence of trial and error. 
								The project extended beyond mere functionality. It aimed to deliver an exceptionally user-friendly experience. 
								I developed straightforward processes for RFID card registration and access monitoring. Complementing this, user manuals and 
								technical guides were meticulously used to facilitate ease of use and understanding.
				
								This project underscores the capability of engineering to simplify and elevate everyday life. Developed, refined, and meticulously designed, 
								this project stands as a testament to the power of technological innovation.
								</p>
								


								<br /><h2 class="major"> Smart Burglar Alarm </h2>
								Using resources from the <a href="https://makerclub.ece.cornell.edu">Cornell Maker Space!  </a> such as a PIR Motion Sensor, a UM3561 pinout, some batteries and resistors, I designed a home scalable 
								smart burglar alarm that alerts the user incase of an any unwanted intrusion. 
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/smartalarm.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								"I designed and implemented a burglar alarm circuit that serves as an effective security solution. 
								This circuit is designed to detect unauthorized entries into residential areas or specific locations.
								<br />(This project was only tested in a dorm room setup )<br />
								
								Instead of traditional transmitters and receivers, I incorporated a PIR (Passive Infrared) motion sensor, which not only improves energy efficiency but also enhances the overall functionality of the system.
								The core of this project is the PIR sensor, which is capable of detecting motion. 
								When motion is detected, it triggers the UM3561 IC, a sound-generating integrated circuit. 
								This IC is programmed to produce a variety of siren sounds, including those resembling a police siren, fire brigade siren, machine-gun sound, and ambulance siren.						
								The operation of the system is straightforward: upon detecting motion, 
								the PIR sensor sends a signal to the IC, activating the speaker and producing a distinct siren sound. To ensure the speaker functions optimally, I incorporated a transistor for current amplification. 
								Users have the flexibility to adjust the duration of the siren sound using the Time delay control regulator on the PIR sensor.								
								For compatibility with PIR sensors that operate on AC voltage, I also integrated a relay control mechanism.
								<br />Below is the schematic <br />
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/alarmschem.png" alt="" /></span>							
								Overall, this burglar alarm system represents a cost-effective and reliable solution to enhance security, 
								offering immediate alerts for any unauthorized movements. It showcased the proficiency in designing and implementing effective security solutions." 
								</p>

							

								<h2 class="major"> Piezzo Based Visitor Sensing <br /> Welcome Mat  </h2>
								Utilizing resources from my engineering club, I designed a smart doormat that would notify me when any guest / visitor steps on the doormat.
						
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/piezo.png" alt="" /></span>
								The doormat project runs on a 555 timer IC and a piezo electric sensor that work together with other 
								basic electric components such as resistors, capacitors ,diodes and transistors to relay a signal whenever someone steps on the mat.
								I used piezzoelectric sensors that use piezolectric effect to measure force and acceleration and then turns this into electric signals.
								The signals in turn turn on the buzzer which alerts the user. (The buzzer should primarily be somewhere close to the owner). 
								With the Piezo sensor built-in, Mat is able to actively monitor any time whether there’s a change in pressure from someone or something standing or sitting on the Mat.
								I am looking into the possibilities of testing different subjects such as (cats, dogs , Roombas , package left outside etc )to 
								see whether they would trigger the alarm. If you trust me with you cat, please feel free to reach out. 

																
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/piezoschematics.png" alt="" /></span>
								
								(Note: I have yet to explore the potential limitations when scaling this project for larger rooms or spaces. The project was primarily tested in a 12 * 20 sq ft dorm room. 
								If time permits, I intend to revisit this project in the near future.)
								</p>

								<h2 class="major"> Alien Invaders </h2>
								Alien invaders is a python game developed using kivy and the turtle library module. It was a final project to my Intro to computing class. 
								This is a replica/clone of the famous  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders">Space Invaders Game!.  </a>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/alien-invaders.png" alt="" /></span>
								This project allowed me to explore game development, combining elements of art, coding, and gameplay design. 
								It's not just a game; it's a tribute to the classics that shaped the gaming world. 
								"Alien Invaders" is a reminder that sometimes, the best way to move forward is to look back at the games that started it all. "This is from a joke my professor made"
								Regrettably, I am unable to share the design and code for this project due to university policies, as it is a recurring assignment within this course. 
								However, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any inquiries or if you'd like to discuss the project further.
								</p>
								
								
								<h2 class="major"> Single Cycle Processor </h2>
								This Project was to design, develop and complete a single cycle microprocessor in Verilog. The microprocessor was to be 
								programmed on an FPGA board so that I could write assembly code that would run on the processor and perfrom single cycle operations.
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/SingleCycle.png" alt="" /></span>
								I took on the challenge of building a single-cycle processor for a digital design project. 
								This processor operates by following five steps: fetching, decoding, executing, handling memory, and writing back. My specific task was to make it work as a level monitor. 
								I tackled this project during a digital logic and computer organization course.
								The processor consisted of six crucial components, each written in Verilog: 
								a Program Counter (PC) counter, Instruction RAM, Decoder, Register File, and a versatile Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that could perform various operations. 
								To control these operations, I designed a control unit that selected the necessary signals using multiplexers.
								In the end, I created an assembly program based on the class's instruction set, similar to MIPS. 
								This program turned the processor into a practical level monitor. When implemented on an FPGA board, it made LEDs light up according to specific conditions.
								This project provided valuable insights into the real-world applications of computer architecture components. 
								It emphasized the importance of careful project planning and step-by-step development to manage complexity effectively. Unfortunately, I can't share the project's code and designs, but I'm here to answer any questions about this fascinating journey into digital design.
								</p>
								
								<h2 class="major"> Sudoku Game </h2>
								Designing a 3 level Sudoku Game. A similar Replica of <a href="https://sudoku.com"> such   </a> , with difficulty (Easy, Medium and Hard)			
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/sudoku3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								During the summer of 2023, I took on this project that has now reached its final stages. 
								However, I encountered some significant complications during the testing phase. 
								Specifically, the backtracking algorithm I implemented failed to solve the Sudoku grid reliably. 
								It struggled to adhere to the  <a href= "https://www.sudokuonline.io/tips/sudoku-rules"> Sudoku Rules </a>
								which is a fundamental requirement for any Sudoku-solving algorithm.								
								My original vision for the project was to create an interactive user experience where the algorithm could step in and 
								solve the puzzle for the user in case they encountered difficulties. The goal was to accomplish this task in under 5 seconds for a smooth user experience. 
								Unfortunately, my algorithm fell short of this performance benchmark, and I'm unable to rely on it to provide quick solutions.  
								In light of this, I am exploring the possibility of rebuilding the algorithm from the ground up, potentially incorporating methods such as 
								Constraint Propagation and the Dancing Links Algorithm (DLX). I had briefly considered linear programming, but it, too, proved to be unviable after a few attempts.
								As of now, I'm unable to allocate more time to continue working on this project due to my return to school, where I'm dealing with demanding and time-consuming projects. 
								However, I'm considering sharing the code on my GitHub repository for anyone who might be interested in reviewing it or potentially contributing improvements. 
								Your insights and feedback would be greatly appreciated.
